# Hospital Dataset Analysis
---

This repository contains an analysis of a hospital dataset stored in an Excel file. The dataset comprises several sheets, each containing different aspects of hospital data such as patient information, visit details, admission records, and more. The analysis involves various data manipulation, visualization, and querying tasks to derive insights and make informed decisions.

## Dataset Overview::
---

The Excel file contains the following sheets:  

**•	Patients:** Basic patient information including patient ID, name, date of birth, race, gender, and language.  

**•	EDVisits:** Emergency department visit details including visit ID, patient ID, visit date, acuity, reason for visit, and disposition.  

**•	AmbulatoryVisits:** Ambulatory visit information including visit ID, patient MRN, provider ID, visit date, blood pressure, pulse, and more.  

**•	ReAdmissionRegistry:** Records related to patient readmissions, including admission and discharge dates, service, primary diagnosis, and readmission flags.  

**•	Discharges:** Admission and discharge information, including admission ID, patient ID, and related details.  

**•	Providers:** Provider details, including provider ID, name, specialty, and date on staff.  

**•	EDUnique:** Unique emergency department visit information including visit ID, patient ID, acuity, reason for visit, and more.  

## Analysis Tasks::

The analysis covers a wide range of tasks, including but not limited to:  

**-** Visualization tasks using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, such as creating pair plots, bar charts, violin plots, joint plots, and heat maps.  

**-** SQL querying to retrieve specific data from the dataset.  

**-** Numpy operations to perform calculations on arrays.  

**-** Creating insightful visualizations like word clouds, donut charts, and sunburst charts.  

**-** Exploring relationships between variables and identifying patterns.  

**-** This analysis provides valuable insights into the hospital dataset, highlighting trends, correlations, and patterns in the data. The tasks covered in this repository demonstrate various data analysis and visualization techniques using Python, making it a useful resource for those interested in healthcare data analysis and visualization.  

**-** A holistic study connecting Tableau , PowerBi to Python and creating reports based on it.

## Challenges and Learning::
